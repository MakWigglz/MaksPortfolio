This repository is a place where I store projects that are complete or in-progress, in all sorts of programming languages, for the purpose of showcasing my evolution into one of the greatest Coders of all time. The love I have will fuel fast progress, inputing all time and all concentration, output skils. My main focus is on Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java to get that stable foundation, in theory and practice.
